# AgentID Value Proposition

## Overview

AgentID provides a foundational layer for autonomous agent identity and trust on blockchain networks. It enables secure, verifiable, and trustable interactions between autonomous agents, smart contracts, and traditional systems.

## Core Value

### 1. Decentralized Trust
- **On-Chain Identity**: Every agent has a cryptographically secure identity on the blockchain
- **Verifiable Claims**: Agents can make and verify claims about their capabilities and permissions
- **Trust Levels**: Hierarchical trust framework from basic verification to cross-chain certification
- **Smart Contract Integration**: Trust is enforced and verified through smart contracts

### 2. Security & Control
- **Cryptographic Security**: Built on Ethereum-compatible secp256k1 cryptography
- **Delegation Control**: Fine-grained control over what agents can do
- **Revocation**: Immediate ability to revoke compromised or misbehaving agents
- **Audit Trail**: All agent actions and verifications are recorded on-chain

### 3. Interoperability
- **Cross-Chain**: Agent identities work across different blockchain networks
- **Standards Compliance**: Implements W3C Verifiable Credentials standard
- **Protocol Agnostic**: Works with any blockchain that supports smart contracts
- **Traditional Integration**: Can bridge to traditional systems through enterprise features
