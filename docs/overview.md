# AgentID Core Overview

## What is AgentID?

AgentID is a foundational component of the Agent Commerce Kit (ACK) that enables secure, verifiable identities for autonomous agents on blockchain networks. It provides a standardized way to establish, verify, and manage agent identities in a decentralized manner.

## Why AgentID?

In the emerging world of autonomous agents and blockchain systems, there's a critical need for:
- **Decentralized Identity**: Ensuring agents can prove who they are without central authorities
- **On-Chain Trust**: Establishing reliable ways to verify agent capabilities on the blockchain
- **Secure Delegation**: Allowing agents to safely delegate authority through smart contracts
- **Cross-Chain Compatibility**: Working seamlessly across different blockchain networks

## Key Concepts

### Agent Identity
An agent identity consists of:
- A unique secp256k1 keypair (Ethereum-compatible)
- On-chain verifiable claims about the agent's capabilities
- A decentralized trust framework
- Smart contract-based delegation mechanisms

### Trust Framework
The trust framework enables:
- On-chain verification of agent claims
- Smart contract validation of agent capabilities
- Decentralized reputation systems
- Secure delegation through smart contracts

### Lifecycle Management
AgentID supports the complete lifecycle of agent identities:
1. **Creation**: Generating secure keypairs and initial claims
2. **Verification**: On-chain validation of agent identities
3. **Delegation**: Smart contract-based authority transfers
4. **Revocation**: On-chain handling of compromised identities

## Use Cases

### Decentralized Commerce
- Secure agent-to-agent transactions on-chain
- Verifiable agent capabilities for DeFi services
- Trusted delegation of payment authority through smart contracts

### Blockchain AI Systems
- On-chain identity verification for AI agents
- Smart contract validation of AI services
- Decentralized delegation of AI agent authority

### Cross-Chain Integration
- Unified identity across different blockchains
- Cross-chain agent interactions
- Secure multi-chain operations

## Technical Architecture

AgentID Core is built with:
- **Go**: For high-performance identity management
- **Solidity**: For on-chain verification and enforcement
- **EIP-712**: For structured, human-readable signatures
- **secp256k1**: For Ethereum-compatible cryptographic operations

- [Use Cases](./use-cases.md)

## Standards and Compliance

AgentID implements the [ACK-ID specification](https://www.agentcommercekit.com/ack-id/standards) and is designed to be compatible with:
- EIP-712 for structured data signing
- ERC-20/ERC-721 for token interactions
- Ethereum DID standards
- Cross-chain identity protocols

## Security Considerations

AgentID is designed with blockchain security as a primary concern:
- Cryptographic best practices for blockchain
- Secure key management for on-chain operations
- Privacy-preserving verification
- Smart contract-based delegation controls
